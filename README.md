# SIR-model
This code with create a graph of the evolution of a pandemic.
The variables that are involved are:
- Population.
- Initialy infected and recovery.
- Gamma and beta.
- Natality rate.
- Proportion of population vaccinated.

It will also return a print with the value of R0 that is the number of people that got infected by 1 infected person.


Any suggestion to improve the model are welcome but always mention my work.

Hope you like!!
